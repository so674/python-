In Python, the and operator doesn’t always return just True or False.
Instead, it returns the last evaluated value.

Let’s see how it works 

and checks both sides:

If both values are truthy, it returns the second value.

If the first value is falsy (like 0, False, None, ""), it returns the first value immediately.
